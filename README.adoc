= CXF Codegen Gradle

CXF Codegen Gradle is, as the name implies, a Gradle plugin implementation of the
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/maven-cxf-codegen-plugin-wsdl-to-java.html[CXF Codegen Maven plugin].

== Building from Source

You will need https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/[JDK 11] to build CXF Codegen Gradle.

TIP: A comptible JDK will automatically be downloaded by Gradle if you do not have one.
See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html[Toolchains for JVM projects] for more details.

The plugin can be built and published to your local Maven cache using the
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper].

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :plugin:publishToMavenLocal
----

This will build and publish it to your local Maven cache. It won't run any of
the tests. If you want to build everything, use the `build` task:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build
----
